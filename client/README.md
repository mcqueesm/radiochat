RadioChat is a chat application that allows users to chat with people in their
area. Users can select a chat radius between .01 and 1 miles, restricting chat
to users within that range. RadioChat is anonymous and users can change their
names as they please. Chat rooms can also be created. Chat rooms have the same
location as the users that create them. You can only join a chat room if it is
within your chat radius. Click on a room in the 'Rooms' list to join that room.
You can private message users by clicking on their name in the 'Guests' menu.

RadioChat requires that you share your geolocation and will not work properly
without it.
